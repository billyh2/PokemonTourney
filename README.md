Pokémon Battle Simulation
This project is a custom Pokémon battle simulation platform built using Node.js and the Pokémon Showdown battle engine. The application allows users to engage in real-time Pokémon battles with live updates, manage battle logs, and communicate through an integrated chat system. Players can log in to create accounts, or participate as guests with spectator capabilities. The battle system is designed to handle player-versus-player matches and can log every battle move for both players and spectators, ensuring transparency and the ability to review replays. 

To run the project, ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or higher) installed and set up Firebase for user authentication. After cloning the repository and installing the dependencies, you can start the server locally. The platform is accessible via the default port 3000, where users can either log in or join battles as guests. The server logs each battle, enabling users to review replays and track battle history. This project is licensed under AGPLv3, which allows for modifications and redistribution under the same license.
